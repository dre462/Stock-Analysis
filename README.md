## Summary 

### Advantage of Refactoring
An advantage of refactoring the code is that it allows the user to make an analysis on a wide variety of years not just 2017 and 2018

### Disadvantage
It might be difficult to understand by someone who didn't take part in writing the codes

### Advantage of Original Script
An advantage of the original code script is that it was written to specification i.e for the analysis of years 2017 and 2018

### Disadvantage of Original script
It wouldn't be advisable to use the original written codes to run analysis of years other than 2017 and 2018
